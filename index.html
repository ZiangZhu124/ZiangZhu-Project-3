        When you walk around the streets and avenues across every borough in New York City, you will always find these structures installed on the side of the streets with rectangular LED screens advertising local news, weather forecasts, etc. You might think it was just a structure only used to display information. However, when you take a closer look at this structure, you will find its capability is more than just displaying information to the public; it was also designed to provide citizens and tourists of New York City with free wireless internet, a charging spot for smartphones, and a public telephone. It was not just a structure designed for displaying advertisements; it was a kiosk that provided all accessible features at any time when you're in the city, and its name is LinkNYC.

      <h1 class="section-title">History</h1>
      <p class="text">
        The history of LinkNYC kiosks dates back to April 2014, when the New York City Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (Abbreviated as OTI) proposed a new accessible wireless communication structure to replace the old and obsolete payphone station. Since smartphone and wi-fi internet became a new trend in wireless communication, OTI decided to design and create a publicly accessible free internet kiosk that helps smartphone users communicate everywhere around the city as its primary function while retaining its public telephone functions, such as calling emergency services.<br></br>
        The first two LinkNYC kiosks were initially installed in late 2014 to 2015 as a beta test site on Third Avenue in Manhattan to prove their reliability in wi-fi connections. Following the successful testing of the kiosks in January 2016, additional installments in the other four boroughs were bumped up to priorities.<br></br>
        With the foundations and experiences accumulated during the initial testing of the LinkNYC kiosk, the first mass expansion plan began in mid-2016, aiming to install 400 kiosks across the downtown areas of each borough, with Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens and Staten Island receiving its first sets LinkNYC kiosks in their neighborhoods. After the first mass expansion plans, the installations of these kiosks became more common as there were 920 kiosks in 2017 and 1600 kiosks in 2018 around New York City, and by the year 2019, there were 1774 LinkNYC kiosks proceed by 1869 kiosks in the mid-2020. In 2021, a newly upgraded kiosk with 5G modules was installed in New York City to provide an even faster and more efficient network for everyone in the city. If the installation plan follows everything, there will be 7500 kiosks in 2024.
